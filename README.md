# Swarm Robotic Platform
### Josh Cohen

## Intro
With the goal of making decentralized, equitable, and sustainable systems, swarm robotic systems seem like a promising framework. Inspired by the success of the open source hardware community over the past 10 years and works like the [swarmbot: Jasmine](http://www.swarmrobot.org/), I hope to attempt to design my own low cost platform that can help propel swarm robotics into the real world. 

## TI CC1310
This is the [micro-conrtoller](http://www.ti.com/product/CC1310) we are using due to its small profile, low power consumption, and integrated RF capabilities. This board is currently interfacing with a Pololu Zumo robot through a custom connector board.
